Hi. Before we get into specifics, do NOT uninstall VaporEmu.html. That will be what you use to get the games up and running. First, double click on VaporEmu.html. When you get to the site, click the thing at the top of the white menu reading, "Autodetect." This will automatically detect what console you want to play on. Controllers work too. Also, if you have progress on a game that you would like to save, save in game, then press on "State" and click on "Save State." Don't close it out until it fully saves. Also, back up the save state file on your google drive by downloading the state on the same menu you clicked earlier. Have fun. Also, eject the USB by double clicking on it's name in the files and pressing "Eject" before you take it out. I don't want to lose any data.
